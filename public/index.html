          <p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I focus on gender, bureaucracy, and representation with a regional focus on India.</p>

<p>My dissertation focuses on how bureaucrats react to the entry of minority politicians, particularly women, and the effects of bureaucratic-politician interactions on policy outcomes. I additionally focus on the strategies minority politicians use to overcome differential treatment. My research is generously supported by the <a href="https://iis.berkeley.edu/">Institute of International Studies (UC Berkeley)</a>, the <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/wfrde/home">Weiss Family Fund</a>, and the <a href="http://cpd.berkeley.edu/">Center for Politics of Development</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked as a <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/">J-PAL Policy Consultant</a> for the Ministry of Rural Development in India to create policy implementation plans for finance management reforms and rural poverty reduction. I have additional experience with managing experiments and research with <a href="https://oneacrefund.org/">One Acre Fund</a> in Kenya and running social enterprises in India and Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>I hold a Master&rsquo;s degree in Area Studies from the <a href="http://www.southasia.ox.ac.uk/msc-contemporary-india">University of Oxford</a> with a concentration on Modern South Asia. Prior to that, I graduated from <a href="https://sanford.duke.edu/">Duke University</a> with a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Public Policy and a certificate in Documentary Film Making.</p>

    <div>My dissertation seeks to create a comprehensive theory of how administrative elites react to the entry of minorities, especially women, into political institutions and how their reactions impact policy outputs in minority-led constituencies. When bureaucrats have negative attitudes about the capability of women as leaders, under what conditions do they exercise discretion in policy implementation? What are the implications for minority politicians when bureaucrats exercise discretion and how do these politicians  react? This dissertation seeks to understand the political economy of bureaucrat-politician interactions and its effects on both politicians and the constituencies led by these politicians in India.</div>

    <div>This book updates the existing public service delivery literature and state capacity literature for a missing link: the public finance mechanisms that fund public services. Public finance mechanisms are a core link in ensuring budget allocation trickles down to program implementers for public service delivery. When poorly structured, public finance mechanisms can stall fund flow and create systemic issues that stymie public service delivery. Bang for the Buck outlines these issues that result from a poor public finance management system and offers a comprehensive reform plan for policymakers.

    <div>Do survey incentives that improve response rates in the United States and the Global North perform just as well in other countries? Studies on web survey recruitment have largely come to a conclusion that monetary incentives recruit a higher share of respondents than non-monetary responses. Though these findings largely come from the U.S. or Europe, scholars in other regions have relied on similar monetary incentives such as gifts or lotteries to recruit respondents. We test the assumption that monetary incentives are effective across cultures by running an incentives experiment in Australia, India, and the United States amongst a similar population of pro-social individuals in each country. We find that monetary incentives are effective in the U.S. and Australia, but Indians respond more frequently to charity appeals or descriptive appeals. An additional dictator game corroborates this finding, showing that Indians are much more likely to donate potential lottery winnings to charity than individuals from other countries. Our results suggests that incentives that have worked in Western settings cannot be transported to other settings without prior testing and a careful consideration of the cultural or socioeconomic context of a country.</div>

    <div>In countries that regard marriage to be of high importance, why do we see so many unmarried or widowed female candidates? To test whether this is a result of demand-based effects, I test this puzzle through a large-scale conjoint experiment in India. I find that though research to date suggests voters prefer married female candidates, voters in the urban Indian setting are indifferent to women's marital status. Rather, voters overwhelmingly decide on female candidates based on their party affiliation, along with dynastic status and profession. Moreover, they tend to punish women with more than one child. The findings bear into question whether parties put forth candidates that align with voters' interests and whether theories of representation hold in the Indian setting.</div>
