[{"categories":null,"contents":"My dissertation seeks to create a comprehensive theory of how administrative elites react to the entry of minorities, especially women, into political institutions and how their reactions impact policy outputs in minority-led constituencies. When bureaucrats have negative attitudes about the capability of women as leaders, under what conditions do they exercise discretion in policy implementation? What are the implications for minority politicians when bureaucrats exercise discretion and how do these politicians react? Broadly, this dissertation seeks to understand the political economy of bureaucrat-politician interactions and its effects on both politicians and their constituencies in India.\n","permalink":"/publications/dissertation/","tags":null,"title":"The Laments of Getting Things Done: The Case of Female Politicians and Bureaucrats in India"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Public finance management, or PFM, refers to the rules, systems, and processes that govern revenues, allocations of funds, expenditure, accounting, and auditing of public finances. Without financial resources to run programs, public service delivery will consistently fail, and many have argued it has in India. Somewhere in the pipeline of the government allocating resources and beneficiaries receiving services, public funds remain unspent, leak out of the system or fail to yield results. These leakages of funds out of the system result from non-transparent and inefficient systems of PFM, which many states have hardly reformed for decades.\nBoth political science scholars and economists have explained India\u0026rsquo;s weak state capacity through political economy and institutional failures. Bureaucratic decisions are politically influenced; administrators are laden with an overwhelming amount of work; corruption is rampant; and inadequate monitoring produce unaccountable public services. These partially explain why, despite decades of public spending, India\u0026rsquo;s publicly funded programs haven\u0026rsquo;t managed to lift approximately 22 per cent of its population out of poverty. However, they do not fully explain why otherwise well-intentioned government programs still suffer from execution failure.\nWe argue that while many of the failures identified by scholars contribute to poor public service delivery, they are also symptoms of the broken PFM architecture. Corruption, poor monitoring, and overburdened administrators do produce poor services, but the broken PFM system exacerbates these problems, among others. We identify six core deficiencies of India\u0026rsquo;s PFM system, financial float, corruption, poor auditing, low transparency, administrative burdens, and challenges for beneficiaries.\nBang for the Buck examines the six aforementioned deficiencies through primary interviews and case studies. We then build the case that in order to overcome these critical deficiencies stemming from its finance management framework, the government must modernize the PFM. We focus a section of the book for policymakers and stakeholders who seek such reforms by outlining a policy implementation plan with a sequential and phased approach to actualize modernization.\nOverall, the book provides theoretical and empirical evidence on how public finance management impacts public service delivery and builds a holistic action plan for reforms.\n","permalink":"/publications/bangforbuck/","tags":null,"title":"Bang for the Buck : Reforms to Maximize Public Funding Outcomes in India (With A.

Studies on web survey recruitment have largely come to a conclusion that monetary incentives recruit a higher share of respondents than non-monetary responses. Though these findings largely come from the U.S. or Europe, scholars in other regions have relied on similar monetary incentives such as gifts or lotteries to recruit respondents. We test the assumption that monetary incentives are effective across cultures by running an incentives experiment in Australia, India, and the United States amongst a similar population of pro-social individuals in each country. We find that monetary incentives are effective in the U.S. and Australia, but Indians respond more frequently to charity appeals or descriptive appeals. An additional dictator game corroborates this finding, showing that Indians are much more likely to donate potential lottery winnings to charity than individuals from other countries. Our results suggests that incentives that have worked in Western settings cannot be transported to other settings without prior testing and a careful consideration of the cultural or socioeconomic context of countries.\n","permalink":"/publications/incentives/","tags":null,"title":"Are Incentives Universally Effective?

To test whether this is a result of demand-based effects, I test this puzzle through a large-scale conjoint experiment in India. I find that though research to date suggests voters prefer married female candidates, voters in the urban Indian setting are indifferent to women\u0026rsquo;s marital status. Rather, voters overwhelmingly decide on female candidates based on their party affiliation, along with dynastic status and profession. Moreover, they tend to punish women with more than one child. The findings bear into question whether parties put forth candidates that align with voters\u0026rsquo; interests and whether theories of representation hold in the Indian setting.\n","permalink":"/publications/marriageeffect/","tags":null,"title":"The (Null) Marriage Effect : Votersâ€™ Indifference to Marital Status of Female Candidates in India."},{"categories":["R"],"contents":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.
