date: 
pubtype: "Dissertation Project"
featured: true
description: "My dissertation seeks to create a comprehensive theory of how bureaucrats react to the entry of minoritized politicans---both women and ethnic minorities----into political institutions and how their biases impact policy outputs in minority-led constituencies. When bureaucrats have negative attitudes about the capability of minoritized politicians as leaders, under what conditions do they exercise discretion in policy implementation? What are the implications for politicians when bureaucrats exercise discretion and what strategies do politicians use to counter discretion? This dissertation seeks to understand the political economy of bureaucrat-politician interactions and its effects on both minoritized politicians and the constituencies led by these politicians in India."
