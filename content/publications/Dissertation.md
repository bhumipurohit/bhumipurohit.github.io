date: 
pubtype: "Dissertation Project"
featured: true
description: "My dissertation seeks to create a comprehensive theory of how administrative elites react to the entry of minorities, especially women, into political institutions and how their reactions impact policy outputs in minority-led constituencies. When bureaucrats have negative attitudes about the capability of women as leaders, under what conditions do they exercise discretion in policy implementation? What are the implications for minority politicians when bureaucrats exercise discretion and how do these politicians  react? This dissertation seeks to understand the political economy of bureaucrat-politician interactions and its effects on both politicians and the constituencies led by these politicians in India."

My dissertation seeks to create a comprehensive theory of how administrative elites react to the entry of minorities, especially women, into political institutions and how their reactions impact policy outputs in minority-led constituencies. When bureaucrats have negative attitudes about the capability of women as leaders, under what conditions do they exercise discretion in policy implementation? What are the implications for minority politicians when bureaucrats exercise discretion and how do these politicians  react? Broadly, this dissertation seeks to understand the political economy of bureaucrat-politician interactions and its effects on both politicians and their constituencies in India.
