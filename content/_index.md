I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I focus on gender, bureaucracy, and representation with a regional focus on India. 


My dissertation focuses on how bureaucrats react to the entry of minority politicians, particularly women, and the effects of bureaucratic-politician interactions on policy outcomes. I additionally focus on the strategies minority politicians use to overcome differential treatment. My research is generously supported by the [Institute of International Studies (UC Berkeley)](https://iis.berkeley.edu/), the [Weiss Family Fund](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/wfrde/home), and the [Center for Politics of Development](http://cpd.berkeley.edu/).

Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked as a [J-PAL Policy Consultant](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/) for the Ministry of Rural Development in India to create policy implementation plans for finance management reforms and rural poverty reduction. I have additional experience with managing experiments and research with [One Acre Fund](https://oneacrefund.org/) in Kenya and running social enterprises in India and Sierra Leone. 

I hold a Master's degree in Area Studies from the [University of Oxford](http://www.southasia.ox.ac.uk/msc-contemporary-india) with a concentration on Modern South Asia. Prior to that, I graduated from [Duke University](https://sanford.duke.edu/) with a Bachelor's degree in Public Policy and a certificate in Documentary Film Making.
